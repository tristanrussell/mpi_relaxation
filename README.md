# OpenMPI relaxation

This project is an implementation of relaxation methods as used for solving large sparse linear systems. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_(iterative_method)

The project uses OpenMPI and is designed to be run on a ditributed memory system.

This project was built as part of my University course and I was limited to using OpenMPI and distributed computing rather than a hybrid design that could have increased performance on a per node basis.
